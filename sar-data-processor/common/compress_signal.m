function [CompressedSignal] = compress_signal(LinearFMChirp,NoisySignal,peformIFFT,NumberOfSamples)
% compress_signal: Function to compress an Linear FM chirp signal
%   This function takes a Linear FM Chirp and a signal with noise
%   as input and computes the match filter to be returned to the caller.
%   This function takes the complex conjugate of the dFT of the zero padded
%   pulse replica length(minus one), the FFT length should be a few times longer
%   than the pulse replica length to obtain efficient processing.
%   corresponds to option 2 on page 95 of "Digital Processing of Synthetic 
%   ApertureRadar Data" by Ian G. Cumming and Frank H. Wong. ISBN-13: 978-1-58053-058-3.

# Project details
This repo contains MATLAB scripts that can be used to process data received from SAR system. It contains models of a generic radar system as well as algorithms that can be instantiated and used to process SAR baseband complex data. 

Folders
- sar-data-processor:
  - Set of algorithms that can be used to process baseband complex SAR data
- sar-demos:
  - Projects that use real world SAR data to demonstrate the use of the SAR data processing algorithms found in `sar-data-processor`.
- sar-models:
  - MATLAB classes that model Radar systems that were built for transmitting nad receiving SAR data. 

# How to run section
Please explain step by step how to run the code/model and include information about what toolboxes and other resources needed to run it.

# Demo
Add a video or animated gif/picture to showcase the code in operation.
  
# Reference
Add reference papers, data, or supporting material that has been used, if any.
